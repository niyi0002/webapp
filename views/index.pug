  h1 About Us 

  p We are Group 16. And our group has two members Nilay Yilmaz and Kristian Katona. In this project we shared the workload 
  p between each other. While Kristian was working with backend other group member Nilay worked with frontend. 
  p We worked together on database connection and reading and writing from/to database. Even though we shared the work we still 
  p helped each other and did some stuff together.
